Welcome to the Hitchhiker's Guide to Frequent Problems 
===================================

“Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.”

― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Now swap "space" for "the internet".
