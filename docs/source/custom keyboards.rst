Custom keyboards 101
============

.. note::
    This is a guide in progress - still figuring this out for myself. 

Components 
-----

- PCB (printed circuit board): The PCB is lifeblood of your keyboard. It’s the brain and the central unit. The PCB you choose determines the size, features, and layout of your keyboard. Choose wisely.
- Case: The case is what hold everything together and protects it from the elements. You can choose different case materials depending on how durable, aesthetic, or see-through you want your keyboard to be.
- Plate: The plate is an optional component, but it holds the switches in place and adds rigidity to the overall build. Definitely recommended. There are different materials and color choices.
- Stabilizers: The stabilizers determine how the larger keys will feel and sound when using the keyboard. Don’t overlook this component, they are incredibly important.
- Switches: The switches are crucial for customizing the feel and sound of your keyboard. There are so many different switch types out there but they are mostly broken down into three different categories: linear, clicky, and tactile.
- Keycaps: This part really sets the aesthetic for your board. When you sit down to type, you’ll be interacting with the keycaps the most. The profile, design, and durability of the keycaps is really important.
