Common errors: resolved once and for all 
===============

**"x" installed packages not recognized as an internal or external command**

this is most likely a problem concering the PATH

1. find location of packages that cannot be found 

2. see if they are properly installed 

3. try to un- and then reinstall them 

4. check if you can run the command when you cd to the location of the package 

5. if this is possible, add the folder of the package to the PATH (not just any path, but the path path)

6. close and reopen vs-code/terminal 


Last resort 
------
Reinstall operating system.
